# Terraform Challenges by KodeKloud

Terraform Challenges by kodekloud is a course aimed at providing platform to test terraform knowledge in practical scenarios.

Each challenge is different and targets different IAC Environment.

## Challenge 1

I was tasked to create a kubernetes infrastructure including Service and Deployments.

## Challenge 2

I was tasked to create a Docker infrastructure using custom images, volumes, network, containers and links between them.

## Challenge 3

I was tasked with creating an EC2-Instance using aws_key_pair and then use user-data for executing a script or installation of nginx service. Also, I attached an EIP to access this server using the EIP and sent output to a file on IAC server for documentation using local-exec provisioner.
